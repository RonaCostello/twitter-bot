A proto-type twitter bot for the Zooniverse platform

Tweets about a random Zooniverse project when run

At the moment this bot can only run with a local copy of the Panoptes Python Client which supports avatar look up. 

See the pull request on Panoptes Python Client 'Add project avatar resource links':

This is also the master branch on my (RonaCostello) forked Panoptes Python Client.

To handle the Panoptes Python Clent, pyenv was used. Run `source bin/activate` to start.
